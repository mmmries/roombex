Roombex
=======

A functional library that translates from Elixir literals to [Roomba Serial Command Interface](http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/mint/Roomba_SCI_Spec_Manual.pdf).

Initially I am targeting the original SCI specification because I happen to have a 400-series roomba hanging around.

I would be thrilled to add support for more recent SCI specifications (ie the [Create Open Interface v2](http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf)) if other people have actual machines to test out the extra commands.
